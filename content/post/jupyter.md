# Jupyter Notebooks

## Overview

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that can be used to produce and share documents that include a mixture of text, live code examples, equations, and visualization. These can be used in many fields as live teaching documents that embed examples the students can run themselves or modify and run to expand their understanding of the topic. They are commonly used in courses to illustrate data science, scientific simulation or to teach software development itself.

Available Platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux, FreeBSD


## Cost

Jupyter is an open-source product and as such, the technology is free to use. However if you decide to use self-hosted or a comercially hosted deployment (discussed below) there is are potential costs. For a self-hosted solution, there maybe a requirement for server hardware, typically in the range of $2000. For a hosted service such a [Cocalc](https://cocalc.com) there is a monthly subscription fee. According to their website this ranges from $84.77USD/month of 20 students, up to $1652.56 for 4 months with 120 students. 

## Copyright use, licensing, intellectual property

Jupyter Notebooks is a open-source project developed under that Modified BSD License. This allows the software to be used and modified for education or commercial purposes. This only stipulation is all deployments of the software include the original authors copyright notice, list of conditions and disclaimer. These can be view in the [here](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Advantages and Challenges

### General

*Advantages*

* Notebooks are written in Markdown, a simplified markup language.
* Notebooks include text and runnable examples so students can learn on their own.
* Examples are editable, allowing students to explore "what if" scenarios.

*Challenges*

* Notebooks projected on low resolution projectors can be hard to read.
* Examples involving large computation can lockup instructors computer.
* The unfamiliar interface can cause confusion distracting from learning goals.

### Installation Specific

#### Local Deployment on Student Personal Computers

*Advantages*

* No need for additional server resources.

*Challenges*

* Downloads technical knowledge requirement on the students.

#### Self-Hosted Deployment

*Advantages*

* Centrally hosted and available over the internet.
* Students only need browser to access.

*Challenges*

* Requires institutional knowledge (instructor or IT group) or server setup.
* Potential hardware cost.

#### Hosted Deployment

*Advantages*

* Centrally hosted and available over the internet.
* Requires no resources for server setup.
* Students only need browser to access.

*Challenges*

* Potentially large subscription cost.

## Learning Strategy

This technology could be used the for visual encoding and interleaving as described by [(Walsh, 2018)](https://www.emergingedtech.com/2018/07/science-backed-learning-techniques-effective-edtech-should-incorporate/). The use of visualization results from the code examples can help the student better see what is happening in scientific simulation. Interleaving can be achieved when using the notebooks to teach coding by basing the examples on other instructional topics in the students field.


## Pedagogical function

Jupyter notebooks can be used in the following pedagogical areas: presentation technologies, problem-solving technologies, and technologies for accessing learning. Notebooks can and are used in the classroom to present material to students. They can also be written allow students to solve a particular problem or change settings to explore live simulations. Finally, it is possible to setup Jupyter Notebooks as method of assessing the students learning with automatic grading.


## Accessibility Concerns

Do to the nature of mixing code, text and visualizations, Jupyter Notebooks could cause problem for screen reading technologies used by students with visual challenges.

## Special Equipment Required

This equipment required for using Jupyter Notebooks depends on how it is to be deployed by the educators. In the simplist deployment local installation on the students personal computer, all that is required is a machine running Windows, MacOS or Linux. However this deployment requires the student to some familiarity of software installation that maybe beyond their grasp and potentially confusing.

To use the tool in centralized deployment, whereby the notebooks are accessed over the internet, a server is require for hosting. This can be a server provided by the educational institution or a hosting service such as [Cocalc](https://cocalc.com). 

## Online Resources

### Teaching a Learning with Jupyter

[Book Link](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/)

Teaching and Learning with Jupyter is a crowd sourced guide to using Jupyter in educational activities. The initial version of the book was written in November 2018 at George Washington Univerity in Washington, DC. The authors are educators that use Jupyter Notebooks in their courses.

### A Guide to Jupyter Notebooks for Educational Purposes

[Paper link](http://eprints.ucm.es/48305/1/ManualJupyterIngles.pdf)

This paper is a guide to using Jupyter Notebooks based on the experiences of educators at Universidad Complutense de Madrid. This guide include discussion of setup and course management of the tool. It also includes some insites from the authors on the benefits of the tool for students.
