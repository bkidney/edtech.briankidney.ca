### Advantages

* Easy to setup and provide access.
* Works both synchronously and asynchronously.
* Allows students and teacher to visually separate content.

### Challenges

* Cost.
* Requires students to have participation.
* Content needs to be monitored for appropriateness.

## Learning Strategy

From [(Walsh, 2018)](https://www.emergingedtech.com/2018/07/science-backed-learning-techniques-effective-edtech-should-incorporate/), Padlet would be used as part of the peer instruction learning technique. Padlet allows student to particilate in the gathering of material to be used in their education. Brainstorming ideas for a report, gathering reference and organized materials, or to allowing students to find resources to teach each other class materials are just some of the ways it could be used to meet this goal. 

## Pedagogical function

Padlet would fall into the following categories of pedagogical function: organizational technologies, communication and collaboration technologies, presentation technologies. The multi-column design allows users to separate materials however they wish. The tool allows for all students to participate in the gathering and organization of materials to fit their theme. Finally, the visual nature of the tool allows students to choose how to present their material.

## Accessibility Concerns

The University of Northampton has a website that outlines the [accessibility concerns for Padlet](https://askus.northampton.ac.uk/LearnTech/faq/188648). The main concerns are for students with visual challenges. The site does not allow for the tagging of images with alternate text for screen readers, nor does it have a low vision colour contrast.
